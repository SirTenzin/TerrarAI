# TerrarAI - Chat with the Wiki!

TerrarAI is a simple Terraria mod that allows you to chat with the Wiki! It's a simple mod that allows you to chat with the Wiki, and get information about items, NPCs, and more! It uses Groq's API for lightning fast response times and the MediaWiki API to get information from the official Terraria Wiki.

TerrarAI also supports the Calamity and Thorium wiki.gg's, so you can get information about those mods as well!

## Installation:

1. Download the latest release from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3388169770) page.

2. Make an account at [Groq](https://groq.com/)

3. Get your [API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) from Groq.

Done!

You're ready to chat with the Wiki!

## Usage:

To use TerrarAI, simply type `/ai <your query>` in the chat. For example, `/ai how do i spawn planterra` will tell you how to:

![How to spawn Planterra Part 0](https://github.com/SirTenzin/TerrarAI/blob/master/planterra%201.png?raw=true)
![How to spawn Planterra Part 1](https://github.com/SirTenzin/TerrarAI/blob/master/planterra%200.png?raw=true)

To use the other wikis, you can use the /calamity and /thorium commmands in a similar fashion. The mod works best when you ask in full sentences, for example "What is the spawn item for the Moon Lord?" is better than asking "moon lord spawn item", although with AI your mileage will always vary.
